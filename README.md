To create the map to display earthquake data throughout the world, the dataset was imported from USGS using D3. Each earthquake location is plotted on the map, with the magnitude, location, & depth displayed when a marker is clicked. Each marker's size & color is dependent on the depth of the earthquake, with a legend on the bottom to see the color associated with the depth range. 

The visualization can be vieweed by opening the index.html file.
